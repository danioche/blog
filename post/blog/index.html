<p>I will share with you the approach of one project that I&rsquo;m working on several months ago.
The projects is aimed to document the personalization of my linux environment that took (and takes) me a great amount of hours. The feel of owning the system is essential for feeling good working, coding, or just enjoing browsing.</p>
<p>Common problems are because I&rsquo;m a little bit of distro-hopping user. I like to change/tests new distros and that makes me lost some configuration and .files on the process.</p>
<p>So the goals are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Control, on changes and versions made</li>
<li>Document, how it is configured/personalized</li>
<li>Automate, the configuration and tools easily</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="how-i-m-dealing-with-this"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.0.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> How I&rsquo;m dealing with this?</h4>
<p>I followed the approach on splitting the problem in thouse 3 main issues:</p>
<h5 id="control"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.0.1.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Control</h5>
<p>The best way on controlling the project is to use a repository on git, this is far known and it will help to create branches for &ldquo;distro dependency&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also &ldquo;versioning&rdquo; makes a lot of sense when developing changes on <strong>&ldquo;dotfiles&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="document"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.0.1.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Document</h5>
<p>The use of literate programming with <strong>org-mode</strong> is how I solved the problem on having a consistent documentation.</p>
<h5 id="automate"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.0.1.3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Automate</h5>
<p>Using literate programing I can automate some configuration dot files to create, copy, modify the configuration files once the code-block is executed by the user allowing user to execute as wish the code blocks.</p>
<h4 id="the-project-and-some-final-conclusions"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.0.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The project and some final conclusions</h4>
<p>Finally the project is under review in a private repository at this moment I don&rsquo;t see it completed to be shared with you, but I will explain here the main sections:</p>

<p>I found a very quite simple process to deobfuscate CSS files This is
simple, if the CSS is not linked to any page, just link it in the
HTML and open the .html file on Firefox and open CSS inspection with
Developers tools (F12).</p>
<p>Copy all the contents and paste it on a new file, now you have a
readable CSS to work on.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<h2 id="minimizing-blog-concept"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Minimizing the blog concept <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogging<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->minimal<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>This is one of the main principles of this blog: to avoid bloated
meta-information just to support content.</p>
<p>This inspiration comes from the every-day-use of Emacs during several
projects in which I mostly integrate my personal workflow with
professional workflow with Emacs.</p>
<p>Whata are the thoughts behind this blog then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Minimize the no-information data</p>
<p>In other words, every bit of information that you could download
visiting this blog is needed for reading the content in proper way,
the presentation layer info is minimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post everywhere</p>
<p>Once data is minized then the process of publishing is also faster
and lightweight, this would allow me to mainly post with any GPRS
connection sharing WiFi from my mobile on-the-go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trolls safe</p>
<p>Trolls and Heaters are not wellcome, they are needed in www just
because is human-nature, but avoiding the extra expossure on the
Social Media this content is kind-of trolls-free, only will be
visited (if so) by people interested, at least I hope so&hellip; (this
is a trolls calling? maybe, inet usually works opposite as
expected).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="revisiting-your-own-code"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Revisiting your own (old) code <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->code<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->nostalgia<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Almost two weeks ago I received a call for a good friend of mine, and also owner
of an Hardware Store, those kind of familiar SMEs that are commited to survive
through the years thanks for the every effort and their commitment to the
service more over than the product.</p>
<p>Returning to the point, I developed an small Web Application for managing the
Hardware Store, very basic: Customers, Products, Categories, Billing, and so.
That was on 2004, long time ago, the main porpuse of the project was to migrate
from the previous software installed (MSDOS based, yes!). So I suggested to move
to Server-Client capabilities with Web based system, due the lack of resources
of the server I also suggested to go simple with alrady purchased software:
Windows XP Pro. So you get the idea, IIS, ASP Classic (at these time I was
starting .net but I was more handy with PHP, ASP and so,&hellip;). The thing is once
you see the old-fashion code I was feeling with a mixture of shame and pride.</p>
<h3 id="the-spaggetti-code-times"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Spaggetti-code times</h3>
<p>The main problem those days was how to avoid the spaggetti-code, how to separate
the layers to avoid coupling on logic and presentation. That was the first thing
I remembered when I was revisiting the code. I remembered my self trying to
solve the puzzle of creating the HTML structure on the fly reading the objects
from the database. That was inspired by previous projects and common problems faced
but I felt kind of proud from my past me.</p>
<h3 id="the-include-file"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The include file</h3>
<p>Of course also the approach was to separate the business logic from the
functionality / controller that was also included in the project, the only thing
is that all the controlled was included in one library making the class complexity
very high.</p>
<h3 id="the-documentation-and-code-style"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Documentation and code style</h3>
<p>Another thing that I&rsquo;m very proud of is the documentation included in the main
class. Is well structured and aimed to be used and maintained. Cool. The
documentation skills is something that I&rsquo;m working on improving a lot.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Final thoughts</h3>
<p>The exercise of revisiting your own code is a good practice to see what have you
learned and what you should keep working on. I see it like a retrospective on
the evolution of yourself as a coder. This was because my friend need several
modifications and I realized that a 17 years old code was telling me some
history about myself.</p>
<p>Try it yourself, you may find some take aways from the exercise.</p>

<p>This is my very first post exported from Hugo&hellip;
Let&rsquo;s learn!</p>
<ul>
<li>Properties don&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>Title is not present</li>
<li>Date is not present</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to move properties to the top. Does not work
I move it on the subtree.
I have included a title
I have exported when cursor was inside the subtree and seems that is working!</p>
<h3 id="my-learning-curve"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> My learning curve</h3>
<p><strong>First you need to understand Hugo</strong></p>
<p>I started with Hugo (<a href="https://gohugo.io/">https://gohugo.io/</a>) by experimenting with one
beautiful theme <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/">https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/</a>, thanks to this
the theme and the sample project I started to understand better
how Hugo worked.</p>
<p>The main concept that took me time to understand was how Hugo
structured the project and the same time how <em>the hell</em> generates the
published site code.</p>
<p>You can follow this link to know how a Hugo project is strucutred:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Installing and configuring the site was not too hard, the problem
was <strong>getting used to</strong> the publishing process.</p>
<p>Initially I thought that in some dir will be the generated files,
but then realized that Hugo serves the content from memory so
unless you specify the export there is no generated file.</p>
<p>Once I understood the content generation and the structure then I
started moving to the next problem. How I migrate / publish from
my Org-mode?</p>
<p><strong>Adding ox-hugo</strong></p>
<p>This blog is mainly focused in the concept on how with the minimal
over-enginering I can post, as I commented in previous posts.</p>
<p>After managing to reduce the blog in one org file, one css and
publishing and exporting with Emacs I found myself no too happy
with the result because the lack of UI-kindyness. Then I returned
to investigate in Hugo but I wanted to keep my posts and also the
concept on being minimal avoiding server side and other kind of
language to process or store simply text.</p>
<p>So I revisited my Emacs configuration, I tried with Doom Emacs,
but again the same&hellip; I find it over-bloated for just editing&hellip;</p>
<p>I make up again my .emacs config with the esential and I added
ox-hugo.</p>
<p>Instructions here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/</a> Main page</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation is a piece of cake, is just installing the package
from MELPA, the problem (at least I had that problem) is
understanding how the meta-data works and how you export the org
files.</p>
<p>In the Auto-exportation section I had the tips and tools to adopt
the ox-hugo workflow <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/">here is the relevant info</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see on the beginning of this post you will find the
final steps when I finally realized the meta-tags needed and how
to export the org file (subtree in fact) to create automatically
the post.</p>
<p>The most relevant thing is also remarked in the documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>HUGO_BASE_DIR</li>
<li>HUGO_SECTION</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties once setted will allow org file to reach the
correct destination folder and then have the posts published on
place.</p>

<li>Start with Hugo and some Theme</li>
<li>Configure and modify the Theme and make it &ldquo;yours&rdquo;</li>
<li>Go to Emacs and add ox-hugo</li>
<li>Test with some org file configuring and exporting</li>
<li>Ready to go!</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see is not sooo hard, this could be your next week-end
project if you are interested! Enjoy!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating to be following your own footsteps every
time, as you may notice I love exploring, trying new things, tools,
commands, etc&hellip; I would say that I&rsquo;m not the only one that
&ldquo;learned&rdquo; something new on the terminal after looking for some
solutions online and reading some fucking manuals and once
configured properly then you forget it almost instantly.</p>
<p>Having projects structured in repos is not the only way to get
things &ldquo;repeateble&rdquo;, some projects or explorations are mostly
changes on .cfg files, some &ldquo;properties&rdquo; or some &ldquo;dotfiles&rdquo; but they
are more random and sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to group them in one specific project.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, documenting is hard, but is the only way that things
will not be lost on the space of the different installations, backup
folders, and so&hellip;</p>
<p>So what I will try to do to solve this problem, here are my future steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making sure that once I found something relevant I will ask myself the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was hard?</li>
<li>It was some kind-of &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; for the future?</li>
<li>It is worth it to document it?</li>
</ol>
<p>If all the answers to the above questions are YES then I will go to step 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the record:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was already documented online? Then bookmark the solution</li>
<li>Is documented online but you addeded some additional details?
Then I will post it on this website</li>
<li>Is poorly documented or the experiment was personal? Then
create a new .org file with all the details and add it to &ldquo;my-linux-setup&rdquo; project</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this small procedure I find myself more confident that I will
not lost any of the major knowledge that I&rsquo;m investing on my journey
with Linux and other systems.</p>
<p>But this fits only for future projects, what happens with the past?
Should I re-visit my backup&rsquo;d home directories from the past to
search if I found something interesting?&hellip; What procedure I should
perform?</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-data-javascript"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Visualizing data with Javascript <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->javascript<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->data<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Recently I found <a href="https://d3js.org">D3js</a> project, I really found it interesting and I
made a short project to try to implement data visualization using
this library. This post is about the process.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/blog/img/CovidVsYou.png"
         alt="Figure 2: CovidVsYou screenshot"/> <figcaption>
            <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figure 2: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CovidVsYou screenshot</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was difficult for me at the beginnig to understand the
development workflow for this library; the main issue I had was
finding the examples on the <strong>observablehq.com</strong>. The main tutorials
from the official web page <a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a> leads you to learn D3
inside ObservableHQ platform, but I just wanted to learn D3.js on
the basis.</p>
<p>Hopefully I found this page: <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html">https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html</a></p>
<p>With the tutorials found I was able to manage to start the project.</p>
<p>The project that i&rsquo;ve created to apply these concepts/libraries is
kind-of-stupid :) I feel sorry, I called: <strong>&ldquo;Covid vs You&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to explain: the aim of the project was to visualize the
Covid data (from Spain, in regard of total of positive tests
reported) and navigate the data exploring photos that the
user/me/you took during the pandemic. What I was envisioning was the
paradox between the visual effect on the epidemic contect against
your/mine &ldquo;happy&rdquo; photos (hopefully). I made to myself the following
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where were you being and doing during this global mess?</li>
<li>How you resisted against all this?</li>
<li>Did you had good times, after all?</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to relate the data of the reported positive cases
and the data extracted from the pictures I needed to read the meta
info from the JPG files. This is possible by using the npm
javascript library <a href="https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js">https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js</a></p>
<p>Also I wanted to use 100% Emacs during the development of this
project avoiding to use VSCode that is what I&rsquo;m very used to.</p>
<p>What I learned?</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create interactive SVG graphs reading from CSV files with
D3js</li>
<li>How to add npm libraries to a Web project</li>
<li>How to start a simple Web server using npx</li>
<li>How to read the Meta information of JPG files</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you could find useful the project if you are interested in one
or more of these topics, if so, fell free to visit the repo it is
published on my Github Repo:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danioche/CovidVsYou">https://github.com/danioche/CovidVsYou</a></li>

<p>You will find on the Readme the instructions to install and to use it.</p>

<h3 id="inspiration"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->8.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Inspiration</h3>
<p>This comes from the need that I am using python in org-babel to
integrate my PM workflow between org-mode and JIRA.</p>
<p>I find myself very productive and confortable editing plain text
for MoM, TODOs, and actions, and with org-mode I managed to
structure the Just-in-time management workflow needed in my daily-basis.</p>
<p>Probably one day I will post something in regard of some kind of
&ldquo;Literate-Project Management&rdquo;. A mix between GTD-Agile and
org-mode. With a lot of automation (python and Selenium).</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s get to the point: I developed some code using the API
to interact with JIRA and the integration is made with basic
authentication, so it is nice to encript the sections in which
the user and password is present.</p>
<p>After small search I found a tool to do so. <strong>org-crypt</strong></p>

<p>If we use the default configuration everytime we save the org file a
pop-up will show to encript the section, but I want to use the
curren configured PGP key, to do so you will need to specify de ID
of your pub pgp key. You can list it as shown in the section above
and you can configure it on your .emacs as shown in the set-up

<p>That is:</p>

using your key stored.</p>
<p>In order to decript tye section you will need to use
<strong>org-decrypt-entry</strong> once you are (your cursor) in the entry desired
to be decrypted. Secret Phrase will be requested.</p>

<h3 id="problem-motivation"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Problem / Motivation</h3>
<p>For me privacy has been always a concern and a paranoia at the same
time but at the end I found myself thinking&hellip; &ldquo;too effort to
encrypt just my shit&rdquo;. I mean, at the end there is no such big
secrets after all and specially when you expose yourself in daily
basis with all the permissions granted to our beloved Google,
Amazon, Xiaomi, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>But I keep trying to keep things with at least &ldquo;some security&rdquo; so I
decided to explore how to configure more properly secrets on my
linux configuration.</p>
<p>Other goal or motivation is to finally know how to manage Keys,
certificates, and secrets properly.</p>
<h3 id="main-objectives"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Main objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create some safe directories to store sensitive information</li>
<li>Easy to manage</li>

<li>Allow to share on same privacy basis</li>

<p>Hi! it has been a while! Sorry about that, you was expeting me? This
kind of things happens me a lot. Sometimes I get lost in the deepest
pit of myself sourrounded with my own demons and expecting to see
the light one day. I missed you also dear nobody. I&rsquo;m back, maybe
for a while.</p>
<h3 id="problem"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Problem</h3>
<p>I want a place to keep my learning updated, I found myself
traveling between contexts and differents plaftforms: corporate
laptop, personal laptop, personal laptop Windows OS, personal
laptop Linux OS, other personal laptop (my wife or daughter or my
home server - also linux &hellip;) and so on.</p>
<p>It will be nice to have a system to use as one reference for my
knowledge and if I learn something new I could download, update and
backup it/store easily.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Is there any system? I tought in a combination of EMACS + GitHub +
ORG-ROAM, in the sense of having always a way to <strong>capture</strong> new
ideas or to store new knowledge quick and in a reliable way.</p>
<p>So the HLD of this idea will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated emacs with my config in every place (portable?)
<ul>
<li>With my config + org-roam</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GH repo</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
<p>done? Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<h3 id="installation"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10.3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Installation</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s configure org-roam on this environment (fedora), for
installing I will guide you from the <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Installation">official installation guide</a>:</p>
<h4 id="package-install"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10.3.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Package Install</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
</code></pre></div><p>First errors found: Failing public key, i found the following error:</p>
<p>This error seems to be because we are using old EMACS keyring.</p>
<p>Fixed downloading the key-ring-update tar file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnu-elpa-keyring-update.html">https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnu-elpa-keyring-update.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You get the .tar and use then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">
M-x package-install-file RET /path_to_tar_file/gnu-elpa-keyring-update-XXX.tar

</code></pre></div><p>After that I tryed again and &hellip; it worked :D!! 🎆
&hellip;. but then org-roam installed but the nodes can&rsquo;t be
created&hellip;.  after some investigation finally I cleared the
<strong>elpa</strong> folder leaving only the emacsql client for org-roam. Seems
that I was having problems and a lots of issues on different
packages, so I endend clearing up every emacsql package and
installing from elpa site ( here <a href="https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/emacsql.html">emacsql</a> ). It worked! 🐣</p>
<h4 id="getting-started-and-ensuring-that-is-working"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10.3.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Getting started and ensuring that is working</h4>
<p>Now few things has to be done to ensure that is working fine, that are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Org-roam directory configuration</p>
<p>You will need to add the following to your emacs config file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">(setq org-roam-directory (file-truename &#34;~/org-roam&#34;))
(org-roam-db-autosync-mode)
</code></pre></div><p><strong>The last line was the hard one&hellip; that revealed that I
needed to resolve the emacsql thing commented above.</strong> 😌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding org-roam-ui</p>
<p>For a better presentation and use I added also <strong>org-roam-ui</strong> package.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">M-x package-install RET org-roam-ui RET
</code></pre></div><p>Warnings may appear on <strong><strong>Compile-Log</strong></strong> buffer. But if there
are only warnings is just OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuring templates and captures</p>
<p>This is an extra step for the most of you the interactive
version (mainly M-x org-caputure is just ok), but you may
want to add more spice to your dish, for that purpose you
will need to review the templates, there are as many
functions and utils as you want to code, just follow
<a href="https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#The-Templating-System">Templating-System</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep learning</p>
<p>The org-roam is based in the org-mode ecosystem so the
options and extensions on your workflow can be limitless,
this is the beauty of emacs ecosystem btw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>For me is amazing when finally is working :D for the most of
you probably you&rsquo;ll have no problems, but my story is always
learning the hard way&hellip; hopefully now it&rsquo;s working.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="publishing-tool"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->11<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Publishing tool</h2>
<h3 id="how-to"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->11.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> How to</h3>
<p>You will need 2 main projects for using ox-hugo and then hugo for compiling the blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web : This is the &ldquo;backend of the project&rdquo;, mainly this file is
on Web repo you are having this if you can read this, so fine.</li>
<li>Blog: This is the &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; the compiled / static html files baked with Hugo</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that you are editing this with emacs and you are having
ox-hugo installed. Add your post, export with ox-hugo and compile it with hugo.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit and make your post</li>
<li>Export Ctrl+C Ctrl+E this will export the ORG file to .MD
prepared for hugo (export the current subtree or new post)
<strong>otherwise you will get all the org file posted</strong></li>
<li>Check the updates locally
$&gt; hugo server -D
Then you will see the changes <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/">http://localhost:1313/blog/</a></li>
<li>If everything is fine <strong>execute hugo again without any
parameters</strong> and proceed with the next section &ldquo;Publish&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

Then commit push must be executed on the repo.</p>
