This is one of the main principles of this blog: to avoid bloated
meta-information just to support content.

This inspiration comes from the every-day-use of Emacs during several
projects in which I mostly integrate my personal workflow with
professional workflow with Emacs.

Whata are the thoughts behind this blog then:

-   Minimize the no-information data

    In other words, every bit of information that you could download
    visiting this blog is needed for reading the content in proper way,
    the presentation layer info is minimal.

-   Post everywhere

    Once data is minized then the process of publishing is also faster
    and lightweight, this would allow me to mainly post with any GPRS
    connection sharing WiFi from my mobile on-the-go.

-   Trolls safe

    Trolls and Heaters are not wellcome, they are needed in www just
    because is human-nature, but avoiding the extra expossure on the
    Social Media this content is kind-of trolls-free, only will be
    visited (if so) by people interested, at least I hope so... (this
    is a trolls calling? maybe, inet usually works opposite as
    expected).
