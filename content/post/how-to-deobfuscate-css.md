I found a very quite simple process to deobfuscate CSS files This is
simple, if the CSS is not linked to any page, just link it in the
HTML and open the .html file on Firefox and open CSS inspection with
Developers tools (F12).

Copy all the contents and paste it on a new file, now you have a
readable CSS to work on.

Cheers.
