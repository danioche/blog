* Documenting my personalization on linux

I will share with you the approach of one project that I'm working on it several months.
The projects is aimed to document the personalization of my linux environment that took (and takes) me a great amount of hours. The feel of owning the system is essential for feeling good working, coding, or just enjoing browsing.

Common problems are because I'm a little bit of distro-hopping user. I like to change/tests new distros and that makes me lost some configuration and .files on the process.

So the goals are:

1. Control, on changes and versions made
2. Document, how it is configured/personalized
3. Automate, the configuration and tools easily

*** How I'm dealing with this?

I followed the approach on splitting the problem in thouse 3 main issues:

**** Control

The best way on controlling the project is to use a repository on git, this is far known and it will help to create branches for "distro dependency".

Also "versioning" makes a lot of sense when developing changes on *"dotfiles"*.

**** Document

The use of literate programming with *org-mode* is how I solved the problem on having a consistent documentation.

**** Automate

Using literate programing I can automate some configuration dot files to create, copy, modify the configuration files once the code-block is executed by the user allowing user to execute as wish the code blocks.

*** The project and some final conclusions

Finally the project is under review in a private repository at this moment I don't see it completed to be shared with you, but I will explain here the main sections:

* How to deobfuscate CSS
[2021-01-30 s치b]

 I found a very quite simple process to deobfuscate CSS files This is simple, if the CSS is not linked to any page, just link it in the HTML and open the .html file on Firefox and open CSS inspection with Developers tools (F12).

 Copy all the contents and paste it on a new file, now you have a readable CSS to work on.

 Cheers.

* Minimizing the blog concept
[2021-02-06 s치b]

 This is one of the main principles of this blog: to avoid bloated meta-information just to support content.

 This inspiration comes from the every-day-use of Emacs during several projects in which I mostly integrate my personal workflow with professional workflow with Emacs.

 Whata are the thoughts behind this blog then:

 - Minimize the no-information data

   In other words, every bit of information that you could download visiting this blog is needed for reading the content in proper way, the presentation layer info is minimal.

 - Post everywhere

   Once data is minized then the process of publishing is also faster and lightweight, this would allow me to mainly post with any GPRS connection sharing WiFi from my mobile on-the-go.

 - Trolls safe

   Trolls and Heaters are not wellcome, they are needed in www just because is human-nature, but avoiding the extra expossure on the Social Media this content is kind-of trolls-free, only will be visited (if so) by people interested, at least I hope so... (this is a trolls calling? maybe, inet usually works opposite as expected).

* Revisiting your own code
[2021-02-20 s치b]

Almost two weeks ago I received a call for a good friend of mine, and also owner
of an Hardware Store, those kind of familiar SMEs that are commited to survive
through the years thanks for the every effort and their commitment to the
service more over than the product.

Returning to the point, I developed an small Web Application for managing the
Hardware Store, very basic: Customers, Products, Categories, Billing, and so.
That was on 2004, long time ago, the main porpuse of the project was to migrate
from the previous software installed (MSDOS based, yes!). So I suggested to move
to Server-Client capabilities with Web based system, due the lack of resources
of the server I also suggested to go simple with alrady purchased software:
Windows XP Pro. So you get the idea, IIS, ASP Classic (at these time I was
starting .net but I was more handy with PHP, ASP and so,...). The thing is once
you see the old-fashion code I was feeling with a mixture of shame and pride.

** The Spaggetti-code times

The main problem those days was how to avoid the spaggetti-code, how to separate
the layers to avoid coupling on logic and presentation. That was the first thing
I remembered when I was revisiting the code. I remembered my self trying to
solve the puzzle of creating the HTML structure on the fly reading the objects
from the database. That was inspired by previous projects and common problems faced
but I felt kind of proud from my past me.

** The include file

Of course also the approach was to separate the business logic from the
functionality / controller that was also included in the project, the only thing
is that all the controlled was included in one library making the class complexity
very high.

** The Documentation and code style

Another thing that I'm very proud of is the documentation included in the main
class. Is well structured and aimed to be used and maintained. Cool. The
documentation skills is something that I'm working on improving a lot.

** Final thoughts

The exercise of revisiting your own code is a good practice to see what have you
learned and what you should keep working on. I see it like a retrospective on
the evolution of yourself as a coder. This was because my friend need several
modifications and I realized that a 17 years old code was telling me some
history about myself.

Try it yourself, you may find some take aways from the exercise.
